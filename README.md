# **APEX Robotics 2020 Season Code**
## About
This is APEX Robotics' 2020 Season Code, writen in [Rust](https://www.rustlang.org) with the [First Rust Competition](https://github.com/first-rust-competition/first-rust-competition) library.

## Why Rust?
We chose Rust this year for a few reasons:
* It is [**fast**](https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/fastest/rust-gpp.html), comparable to C/C++ performance
* It is (mostly) **memory safe**, with a **helpful compiler**
* **Safe threading is enforced**, allowing us to utilize all of the processing power of the RoboRIO
* The FRC libraries are **significantly smaller**, if less featured (compared to WPIlib)

## How to Build

Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/first-rust-competition/first-rust-competition/blob/master/wpilib/README.md) to deploy the code to a RoboRIO
